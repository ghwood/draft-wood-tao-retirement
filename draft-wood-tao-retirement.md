# Introduction

Since its publication as [RFC1391] in 1993, The "Tao of the IETF" ("Tao") has described the inner workings of IETF meetings and Working Groups, discussed organizations related to the IETF, and introduced the working processes to new participants. The Tao never was not a formal IETF process document, but rather a community-developed and maintained informational overview. After the Tao was published as an RFC for 13 years, it was published as a webpage for over a decade, following the process described in [RFC6722]. However, the Tao did not keep up with the changes in the processes of the community and the organization, and thereby ceased to be a reliable source of information. We gratefully want to acknowledge all the individuals who contributed to the Tao over the years. The changing nature of IETF participation, a better understanding of how to most effectively convey information to new participants, and experience with publishing the Tao as a webpage all suggest a new approach to collecting, updating, and communicating the information new participants need to engage in the work of the IETF successfully. This document formally retires the Tao as the IETF a single standalone document.

# Reasons for Retirement
In short, the breath of topic covered in the Tao, the unpredictable and different schedule for updates to the topics, and the high overhead for revising and reviewing the content did not match the needs or preferences of the intended audience of the Tao.

## Infrequent updates
The Tao was originally published as [RFC1391] in January 1993. In the following 17 years, four additional versions of the Tao were published as RFCs: [RFC1539] in October 1998, [RFC1718] in November 1994, [RFC3160] in August 2001, and [RFC4677] in September 2006. In August 2012, [RFC4677] was published to document the process for publishing the Tao as webpage so that it "can be updated more easily". However, in the subseqent 11 years, only four additional versions were published. The length of the Tao meant that review and approval of the entire document took considerable effort and time, leading to very infrequenet updates.

## Unweildly format
The large, consolidated document format of the Tao made for a heavy investment by readers, in addition to the difficulty editors faced keeping pace with the changes required to keep it current. For example, the emergence of IETF Hackathons' popularity with new participants prompted an update, however, that content was effectively buried in an already long document.

## Changing participation modes
The original Tao aimed to welcome new participants to IETF meetings, as attendance grew rapidly along with the growth of the Internet in the 1990s. Other avenues for initial participation in the IETF emerged over the ensuing decades, the main focus of the Tao remained on in-person meeting participation. For example, remote participation in IETF meetings has become a much more significant aspect in the past few years.

## New communications opportunities
+ More focused guides, for example on IETF Hackathon participation, starting new work
+ Alternative formats, e.g. multiple shorter documents, on-demand video
+ New channels for communications, e.g. Blog posts, improved Datatracker

# Going forward plan

<!-- one thing we've heard about the Tao from current IETF participants, is that they like a single place to point new participant to get started. "Go read the Tao" is an easy recommendation to make, even if the current format of the Tao didn't make it easy for readers to find exactly the bit if information they were looking for. Do we need an alternative to this? For example, "go to the "Getting Started" webpage as a single starting point? OR maybe a small set of tailored getting started guides? E.g. "Getting started with IETF Meetings", "Getting started with IETF Hackathons", "Getting started with IETF Documents", "Getting started wtih IETF Working Groups", "Getting strated wtih technologies in the IETF"? -->

# Conclusion

In short, the Tao's covering a wide range of topics, the unpredictable and different schedule for updates to the topics, and the high overhead for revising and reviewing the content, means that the document required a lot of effort to maintain and was commonly out of date.

# Acknowledgements
