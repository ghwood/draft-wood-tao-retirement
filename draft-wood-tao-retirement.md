# Introduction

Since its publication as RFC1391 in 1993, The "Tao of the IETF" ("Tao") has described the inner workings of IETF meetings and Working Groups, discusses organizations related to the IETF, and introducesd the standards process to those new to the IETF. It was not a formal IETF process document but instead an informational overview. The Tao was published as an RFC for 13 years, after which it was published as a webpage, per RFC4677. With grateful acknowledgement to all the individuals who contributed to the Tao over the years,
