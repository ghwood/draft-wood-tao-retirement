1.  Introduction

   Since its publication as [RFC1391] in 1993, The "Tao of the IETF"
   ("Tao") has described the inner workings of IETF meetings and Working
   Groups, discusses organizations related to the IETF, and introducesd
   the standards process to those new to the IETF.  It was not a formal
   IETF process document but instead an informational overview.  The Tao
   was published as an RFC for 13 years, after which it was published as
   a webpage, per RFC4677.  With grateful acknowledgement to all the
   individuals who contributed to the Tao over the years, the changing
   nature of IETF participation and experience with the process
   described in [RFC6722] recommends a new approach to collecting,
   updating, and communicating information new participants need to
   successfully engage in the work of the IETF.
